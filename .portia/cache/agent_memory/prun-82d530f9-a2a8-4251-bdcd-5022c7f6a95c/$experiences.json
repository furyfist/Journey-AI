One page (christinestravelgems.com) suggests activities such as a macaron-making class, exploring viewpoints of the Eiffel Tower, visiting the D'Orsay Museum and Sacré-Cœur Basilica, seeing the Wall of Love, and touring the Catacombs of Paris and the Palace of Versailles.  A Rick Steves forum post (ricksteves.com) mentions a sewer tour and a visit to the Pasteur Institute as unique experiences. Finally, a Reddit post (reddit.com) recommends a coffee experience at Substance Coffee."
